# Boring Python

## NOTES:
* MOVE to notebook-examples/Boring_Python_Book
* Create TOC in this README
* For each notebook add top level description/summary of what is covered

Here's a series of notebooks that are adapted from the e-book *Automate the Boring Stuff* by Al Sweigart.

The original ebook can be found [here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). 

These are adapted to run on HPC systems. They contain fundemental Python knowledge, projects and examples included. Enjoy!
