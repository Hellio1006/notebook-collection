General-purpose computing on a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), better known as GPU programming, is the use of a GPU together with a CPU (Central Processing Unit) to accelerate computation in applications traditionally handled only by the CPU.


This chapter will give you an introduction to GPU programming. You will able to learn CUDA (Nvidia GPU programming platform) as well as RAPIDS(Nvidia open source software library). Enjoy!
