# Table of Contents
| Chapter   | Package Dependencies  | Keywords/Topics                                | Short Description |
| --------- | --------------------  | --------                                       | ----------------- |
| Chapter 1 | N/A                   | basic, data types, math, operator              | this notebook begins with running expressions into the interactive shell, python math operations, and variable types. It also includes basic string functions and concatenation. |
| Chapter 2 | math, os, random, sys | basic, flow control, flowchart, loops, modules | this notebook dives into booleans, comparison and logic operators, and the elements of flow control, including if/else conditionals and while and for loops. Importing python modules is also explained.                  |
| Chapter 3 | random                | basic, exceptions, functions, variable scope   | this notebook discusses the basics of functions, parameters, and return statements. It also explains the local and global scope of variables and how to handle exceptions and errors in code. |
| Chapter 4 | N/A                   | basic, index, lists, loops, slice, tuples      | this notebook overviews all topics related to lists: indexes, slicing, length, concatenation, removing values. It provides examples for how to implement lists with inputs and loops. |
| Chapter 5 | pprint                | basic, data structures, dictionaries, lists, nested data| this notebook explains dictionaries and the methods associated with them. It implements the pprint module to demonstrate how to "pretty print" dictionary values. The chapter also includes examples for utilizing lists and dictionaries to model real-world applications. |
| Chapter 6 | pyperclip, sys        | basic, strings, index, slice                   | this notebook explores all things for strings, including indexing, spliting, justifying, removing whitespace, and many more methods. Chapter 6 also has 2 project examples to show the use of the pyperclip module.|
| Chapter 7 |                       |          |                   |
| Chapter 8 |                       |          |                   |
